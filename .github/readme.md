My first idea is about a game having as main feature, a character using the turtle module with the adding about that you can controle the motions of the object using the arrow keys and perform a skill that is about using the pen command to create a line that once you circle enemies, you can beat them.


That is the main first idea that I got and in the program (pro.py) is alittle advance that I did.
