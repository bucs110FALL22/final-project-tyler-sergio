Using the example below, list each model class and its interface

1. Class MainCharacter:  
    * def__init__(self,x, y, color, name)
        * This class is going to define the main character of the game, by which it can move around the entire display window, besides giving a color with a key name during the game. 
    * def loop attack(self): One of the principal skills that the main character would have is its attack that consists in the creation of a formation of a structure generated by a line, once that the line reach to end through the formation of any shape, all enemies would be defeated inside the formation.  
    * def lifes(3):   In this case the main character will have a counter of 3 lifes during the game. 





2. Class Enemies:
    * def__init__(self, x, y, color, name)
       * This class present the characteristics of the enemies, being similar to the main character.
    * def spin attack(): The attack of the enemies would be a turn.
    * def defeat(): When enemies receive damage through an attack from the main character, then for all enemies would dissapear.
    



3. Class secondary elements:
   * def __init__(self, motion, color):
   *  From this moment, I am planning to add objects as secondary field or even being part of the scenario.
   *  def timer(): And for final, I want to add a timer to set how many enemies you can beat in a range of time.
